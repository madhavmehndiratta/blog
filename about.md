<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<p align="justify">
This blog is to help readers experience the artistic world of hacking. Hacking is like Chess: The more you do it, The more youâ€™re good at it. Here you will find writeups for CTF challenges, articles about certain topics and even quick notes about different things that I want to remember.</p>

Goals:
- Document what I learn.
- Share knowledge that might help others.
<p align="justify">
PS- There are a lot more amazing ways to crack a system, and maybe you will find more exciting ways than listed. It's just to share the pleasure that I found in my journey, so enjoy my writeups.</p>

<p algin="justify">
Also, this blog is open to both appreciation and criticism. More topics and suggestions for writeups are most welcome. For feedbacks, you can contact me <a href="/contact">here</a> or send an email to <a href="mailto:contact@infosecarticles.com"> contact@infosecarticles.com.</a></p>
