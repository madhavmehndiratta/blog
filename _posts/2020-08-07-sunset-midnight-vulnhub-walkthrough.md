Today I will be sharing a walkthrough of sunset:midnight, a boot2root machine which is available on Vulnhub. I really like all the machines from this author and I recommend you to try out his machines, these are actually good :)

## Initial Enumeration

As usual I started with nmap to check for open ports and services running in the system using the following command:<br>
<b>nmap -sC -sV -Pn -p- -T4 --max-rate=1000 192.168.1.182</b>

I started my enumeration from port 80 and found a website that is not reachable because we need to edit the host name in <b>/etc/hosts</b> file.

I again opened the website and confirmed that this website is developed using wordpress and without wasting my time, I performed a wpscan using the following command:<br>
<b>wpscan --url http://sunset-midnight --enumerate </b>

<img src="/assets/img/uploads/sunset-midnight/wpscan.webp">

I started to search about this plugin and found that it is vulnerable to SQL injection but I don't like SQL injection specially using the tool sqlmap, So I decided to do a bruteforce attack against mysql login with user root and using the dictionary <b>rockyou.txt.</b><br>
<b>hydra -l root -P ../rockyou.txt mysql://192.168.1.182</b>

<img src="/assets/img/uploads/sunset-midnight/hydra.webp">

Awesome! That's great. I found the password very quickly and now we can login into mysql as a root user.

First of all I decided to explore the mysql database and found an interesting table there.

Next, I dumped all the data inside the table <b>user.</b>

I found three hashes, and I got the password after cracking them with <b>John.</b> I was feeling so stupid at this stage because there is no point of cracking these hashes as I already know the root password, I am loosing my common sense. 

Okay, after this I decided to explore the database <b>wordpress_db</b> and found something interesting there (hash of user admin)

<img src="/assets/img/uploads/sunset-midnight/wp-users.webp">

I tried cracking it but failed. Next I thought we are in as user root and we can change the hash of user admin and will use that password to login into wordpress.

Therefore after changing the credentials to admin:admin I was inside the Wordpress panel. Obtaining a low user shell from wordpress was not a difficult task, that's why I am not showing the steps. (You can still find them in some other walkthroughs shared on this blog.)

After some enumeration I found the password of user <b>jose</b> and using that password I logged in as user <b>jose</b> using <b>ssh.</b>

## Root Shell

After that I started to search for SUID binaries and found an interesting one using the following command: <br>
<b>find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null</b>

<img src="/assets/img/uploads/sunset-midnight/suid.webp">

Next, using the strings command on this binary I found that it uses the service command but without using the full path of the service command. So now we can change the PATH variable and will gain access to the root shell.

```r
cd /tmp
echo "/bin/sh" > service
chmod +x service
export PATH=/tmp/:$PATH
/usr/bin/status
```
